1. cup 25 red metal with handle needs to be recollected

2. spatula wood circular 3 is classified as hammer need to be recollected

3. problem of this set of data is that the part affordance of cup cannot be transfered directly to other objects.
   e.g., cup is using handle, opening, body. bowl is using graspable, containable...

4. the mapping from 2d affordance mask to 3d object is also not quite right. Especially for contain affordance, the 2d
mask indicates that inside of the object has the contain affordance, but the mapping from 2d to 3d only labels the back
side of the object for that affordance.
